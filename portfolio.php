						<h1>Rogue: A CS:GO Hack</h1>
						<h2>Website development project</h2>
						<p>This project began through a client who wished for an innovative way to showcase his software without being intrusive yet blantantly obvious. The end result: a simple video clip visualized on endless loop in the background came to be. He also wanted a great way to showcase its features while also offering the opportunity to commit outbound links for each feature. A simple, one-page design was arranged and carried out for Rogue, and offers a platform for new and old users to interact and view the status of the service.</p>

						<h1>Narwals Portfolio</h1>
						<h2>Website development project</h2>
						<p>I began this project to create a one-stop landing page for my alternatively named profile. It utilized simplicity so that users aren't distracted with loads of useless text. Thus, it connected me to my clients more frequently as my only form of communication was limited to email prior to the site's creation. Wandering users could also receive a pathway to the service I provided.</p>

						<h1>Fractals</h1>
						<h2>Website development project</h2>
						<p>Fractals started as a website created for an extra credit project in Calculus. I originally approached my teacher with the idea of developing a single-paged site that presented some factual information about fractals, and he enjoyed the idea. He continued to use the site as a simple demonstration for all students learning about the potential of fractals, and I agreed to keep the site live for as long as possible.</p>

						<h1>RolePlay Central Landing Page</h1>
						<h2>Website development project</h2>
						<p>RolePlay Central was the birthchild of a videogame plugin's creation. In response to the release of Arma III: Life, a plugin that allowed gamers to roleplay as emergency responders, RPC started up as a popular go-to server. They maintained a forum board with over 3000 users until the owners had split paths and the server shut down. The live example is hosted locally as the site was shut down with the server.</p>

						<h1>Titus Design Home</h1>
						<h2>Website development project</h2>
						<p>My company needed a landing page for clients and potential customers to explore, so I spent a good amount of time building this entire page from the ground up with nothing but coffee and a few missed nights of sleep. In the end, it came out to be perfect for our needs and contains the right amount of content that our company is looking to showcase.</p>

						<h1>Flipster Website Template</h1>
						<h2>Website template</h2>
						<p>I worked closely with a client who was interested in starting his own mix of Craigslist and Ebay, called Flipster. He approached me to design website layouts that would then be converted into live code by his personal developer. However, the site never went live to do personal conflicts between the site's creator and developer. The templates, which reached multiple different designs, still remain on my online image portfolio and can be seen by clicking below.</p>

						<h1>Flyde and Wire Website Demo</h1>
						<h2>Website template</h2>
						<p>Flyde and Wire was a mock company that was used as a reference point for the creation of this layout demo. After talking with another graphic designer, he had asked me to produce a website layout that encompassed this "businesses" features. I accepted his task, and this layout was the conclusion of a half hour of work.</p>

						<h1>CloudStrategies Website Refacing</h1>
						<h2>Website development project</h2>
						<p>CloudStrategies, a company that I have worked at since 2015, brought me abroad to help resurface their online presence. I began by refacing their landing page, which included the development of a header image switcher that runs daily; a new image is shown for every day of the year. I assisted in the revamp of the company's social media reach and continue to maintain these channels today.</p>
